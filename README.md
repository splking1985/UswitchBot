## For the uSwitch bot and editing of energy form

I have included a template extension which creates a button in the toolbar, the panel that opens below it has a link, and when that link is pressed a page is opened and jQuery and a content script is attached. You'll need to edit this slightly but it should get you started.

The form is located in /forms/forms/energy/ and contains an existing set of fields. You'll need to add any new fields that are on the uSwitch form, but please don't remove any of the extra/unused fields from this form since these are used elsewhere.

Finally there is a variable list under /product-data/energy/variable-lists/ (you want to look for the one with the highest number, in this case, List #3). If you find any more fields that you have to add to our form, also add them to the variable list. You'll see the format in which they must be in. There is also some test data, but again, you'll need to update that as you add more fields.
